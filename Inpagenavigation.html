    <a name="CS">Client-Server</a>
    <p>Client-server architecture is a foundational model in system design where multiple clients (devices or applications) interact with a central server to request and receive services or resources. This model is widely used in web applications, databases, and network-based systems due to its efficiency, scalability, and centralized management.

Key Components

The architecture consists of several essential components:

Client: A device or application that initiates requests to the server. It handles user interactions and processes server responses.

Server: A powerful machine or application that processes client requests, performs computations, and provides the requested resources or services.

Network: Facilitates communication between clients and servers using protocols like HTTP, TCP/IP, or WebSocket.

Middleware: Acts as an intermediary, providing functionalities like authentication, logging, and message queuing.

Database: Stores and manages data requested by clients, ensuring consistency and security.

How It Works

The client-server interaction typically follows a request-response model:

The client sends a request to the server (e.g., via HTTP or SQL).

The server processes the request, retrieves or computes the necessary data, and sends a response back to the client.

The client displays the response to the user or performs further actions based on it.

For example, when accessing a website, the browser (client) sends a request to the web server, which responds with the necessary HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files to render the page.

Advantages

Centralized Management: Simplifies updates, maintenance, and security by centralizing resources on the server.

Scalability: Can handle increased demand by upgrading servers or adding more servers.

Resource Optimization: Separates user-facing tasks (client) from intensive processing (server).

Enhanced Security: Centralized servers allow better control over data and access.

Real-World Examples

Web Servers: Host websites and respond to browser requests.

Email Servers: Manage sending and receiving emails.

Banking Systems: Enable secure online transactions and account management.

IoT Systems: Collect and process data from connected devices.

Types of Client-Server Architecture

1-Tier: All components (UI, logic, and data) reside on a single device.

2-Tier: Separates the client (UI) and server (database), with logic on either side.

3-Tier: Adds middleware between the client and server for better scalability and security.

N-Tier: Extends 3-tier by isolating additional functionalities into separate layers.

Client-server architecture remains a cornerstone of modern computing, enabling efficient communication, resource sharing, and robust system design across diverse applications.</p>

<a name="CWA">Components of Web Application</a>
<p>A basic website or web application consists of several interconnected components that work together to deliver functionality and user experience. These components can be broadly categorized into User Interface (UI) Components and Structural Components.

User Interface (UI) Components

These components are responsible for the visual and interactive aspects of the application. They include elements like activity logs, dashboards, notifications, settings, and statistics. These components focus on enhancing the user experience and do not directly handle the application's core functionality.

Structural Components

Structural components handle the core functionality and data management of the application. They include:

Client-Side (Frontend): This is the part of the application that runs in the user's browser. It is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (or related frameworks). It handles user interactions and communicates with the server via HTTP requests. The client-side code is visible and editable by the user.

Server-Side (Backend): This component processes user requests, executes business logic, and interacts with the database. It is built using programming languages like Python, Java, PHP, or Node.js. The server-side code is not visible to the user and ensures secure data handling.

Database: This is where all the persistent data is stored. It interacts with the server-side logic to retrieve, update, or delete data as needed. Databases can be relational (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) or non-relational (e.g., MongoDB).

Three-Tier Architecture

Web applications often follow a three-tier architecture for better scalability and maintainability:

Presentation Layer: This is the user-facing layer that includes UI components built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It handles user interactions and displays data.

Business Logic Layer: This layer processes user requests, applies business rules, and determines how data is accessed or manipulated. It acts as the control center of the application.

Persistence Layer: This layer manages data storage and retrieval. It ensures that the business logic has seamless access to the required data.

Additional Considerations

Modern web applications may also include cross-cutting concerns like security, operational management, and third-party integrations (e.g., payment gateways, social logins). These aspects ensure the application is robust, secure, and user-friendly.

By understanding these components, developers can design scalable, secure, and efficient web applications tailored to user needs.</p><br><Br>

    <a name="HTTP">HTTP-HTTP Request</a>
    <p>Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-layer protocol used for transmitting hypermedia documents, such as HTML. It is the foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web, enabling the transfer of data between a client (usually a web browser) and a server.

Key Principles and Methods

HTTP follows a classical client-server model, where a client opens a connection to make a request and waits for a response from the server. It is a stateless protocol, meaning that the server does not retain any session data between two requests. The protocol supports various methods, each serving a different purpose:

GET: Retrieves data from a specified resource.

POST: Submits data to be processed by a specified resource.

PUT: Updates or creates a resource on the server.

PATCH: Partially modifies a resource.

DELETE: Removes a specified resource from the server.

HEAD: Similar to GET but retrieves only the response headers.

OPTIONS: Retrieves the communication options available for a resource.

TRACE: Echoes the received request back to the client for debugging purposes.

CONNECT: Establishes a tunnel to the server through an HTTP proxy.

HTTP Request/Response Cycle

HTTP operates on a request-response cycle between clients and servers. The basic flow is as follows:

Client sends an HTTP request: The client initiates the process by sending an HTTP request to the server. This request includes a request method (e.g., GET, POST), the target URI, headers, and an optional request body.

Server processes the request: The server receives the request and processes it based on the requested method and resource.

Server sends an HTTP response: After processing the request, the server sends an HTTP response back to the client. The response includes a status code (e.g., 200 OK, 404 Not Found), response headers, and an optional response body containing the requested data or content.

Client processes the response: The client receives the server’s response and processes it accordingly.

HTTP Versions and Evolution

HTTP has evolved over time to improve performance and security:

HTTP/0.9: The initial version introduced in 1991, supporting only the GET method.

HTTP/1.0: Introduced in 1996, added more methods and headers.

HTTP/1.1: Introduced in 1997, added persistent connections and chunked transfer encoding.

HTTP/2: Published in 2015, introduced a binary protocol, header compression, and multiplexing.

HTTP/3: Published in 2022, uses QUIC instead of TCP for the underlying transport protocol, improving web performance.</p><br><br>
    <a name="DWP">Dynamic Web Pages</a>
    <p>A dynamic web page is a web page constructed at runtime (during software execution), as opposed to a static web page, delivered as it is stored.

A server-side dynamic web page is a web page whose construction is controlled by an application server processing server-side scripts.[1] In server-side scripting, parameters determine how the assembly of every new web page proceeds, and including the setting up of more client-side processing.

A client-side dynamic web page processes the web page using JavaScript running in the browser as it loads. JavaScript can interact with the page via Document Object Model (DOM), to query page state and modify it. Even though a web page can be dynamic on the client-side, it can still be hosted on a static hosting service such as GitHub Pages or Amazon S3 as long as there is not any server-side code included</p>
   <br><br>
    <a name="AS">Application Servers</a>
    <p>An application server is a server that hosts applications or software that delivers a business application through a communication protocol. It provides an environment where applications can run, regardless of what the applications are or what they do. The primary goal of an application server is to enable developers to focus on the business logic of their applications by providing a robust and scalable infrastructure.

Key Features

Application servers offer several key features, including:

Clustering: This allows multiple servers to work together to provide high availability and scalability.

Fail-over: This ensures that if one server fails, another server can take over without interrupting the service.

Load-balancing: This distributes the workload across multiple servers to optimize resource utilization and performance.
